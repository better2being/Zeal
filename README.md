## Zeal
The app displays an excited poem named The Answer.

It enables stir our blood and it is special for my idol poet, Bei Dao.

The app is the first app finished by myself last year, Feb 2016.

It seems nice or fine, and also simple or foolish.

It means the start of my travel with Android and also commemorates the end of my college and youth.

Thanks for all of your zeal.
